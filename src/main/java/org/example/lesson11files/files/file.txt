Researchers who flipped coins 350,757 times have confirmed that the chance of landing the coin the same way up as it started is around 51 per cent.
If you flip a coin, the odds of getting heads or tails are an equal 50 per cent chance – right? While this is what statistics textbooks will tell you,
there is increasing evidence that it isn’t quite true in the real world.
In 2007, researchers theorised that when a coin is flipped, the flipper’s thumb imparts a slight wobble to it,
causing it to spend more lessons with one side facing upwards while in the air and making it more likely to land showing that side.
They predicted that a coin should land showing the same side that was facing up when flipped approximately 51 per cent of the lessons.
